# Overview

**TQA** (creatively *TanStack + Query + Axios*) is a React hooks library that
aims to standardize the (wait for it) TanStack Query & Axios implementation by
offering prebuilt wrappers for the `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`
requests.

In a typical client application, it's common to perform HTTP requests to
interact with a set of REST APIs, while also needing to access the response's
status code and HTTP error's information - all of this with comprehensive
TypeScript support. TQA's hooks will perform this work for you while allowing
you to easily customize them.

## Requirements

### TanStack Query

**Version 5+**

Every single query or mutation performed by mean of TQA will require a key. This
is an opinionated take that's been coded into the library as TanStack Query
doesn't require it.

Another thing to keep in mind is that the query and mutation functions won't be
accepted as part of the hook's configuration, as they're completely handled by
the hooks. The rest of the configuration will be completely customizable by
the user.

### Axios

**Version 1+**

Every request will be performed with an Axios HTTP client. The client will be
referenced as *consumer*, and will always require an endpoint - either a plain
string or an `URL` instance.

Unlike for TanStack Query, no default configuration is provided to Axios out of
the box.

## Features

### Rich data

Access more than the bare data when a response is returned:

```ts filename="TypeScript"
const {
  data: { request, response, headers, status, statusText },
} = useRetrieve(url, opt, client);
```

### Strong type safety

TQA was built with type safety in mind, ensuring you always know how to interact
with your data. Each hook offers the ability to fully define your data:

```ts filename="TypeScript"
useRetrieve<Req, Res, Params, Err>(url, opt, client);
```

### Request cancellation

TanStack Query offers the ability to cancel pending queries by mean of its
built-in `queryClient`, provided you pass your controller's signal to the
query function. This work is already covered by TQA under the hood so that
you only have to interact with `queryClient`:

```ts filename="TypeScript" copy=false
queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey: [/* ... */], exact: true });
```

This applies to all the `GET` and `HEAD` requests, excluding those that are
performed with mutation-based hooks.

### Pagination

TQA supports two different pagination strategies: **infinite** and
**directional**. Both approaches offer built-in support for `GET` and `POST`
request methods and solutions to build and configure your own wrappers. The
provided hooks allow to easily support different pagination strategies, such as
limit + offset or page + size.

### Immediate and on-demand mechanisms

TQA provides an easy solution to fire `POST` requests as soon as your component
mounts, just like a query would do, as well as the ability to fire `GET`
requests on demand, with mutation-like dynamics, to accomodate how different
back-ends operate.

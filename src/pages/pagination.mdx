# Pagination

TQA supports different pagination strategies and approaches, while also
providing flexible wrapping tools to configure your very own reusable solution.

## Supported strategies

### Infinite

The **infinite** pagination strategy allows the user to perform pagination
seamlessly while scrolling the records, e.g. by mean of a "load more" button or
the scrolling action itself. This is considered a modern approach that's widely
adopted.

### Directional

The **directional** pagination strategy is a more traditional way of preforming
pagination, by mean of two navigation buttons ("previous" and "next") which will
allow to display only `n` items at a time.

## Available approaches

### Limit & offset

Many back-ends will allow to perform pagination by mean of the `limit`
parameter (the amount of items per page) and the `offset` parameter (the
pagination index, related to how many items per page the user is requesting).

For example, an API based on this approach, upon requesting **10** items per
page, would work as follows:

- `/api/foo/bar/?limit=10` (implies `offset=0`)
- `/api/foo/bar/?limit=10&offset=10`
- `/api/foo/bar/?limit=10&offset=20`
- `/api/foo/bar/?limit=10&offset=30`

And so on.

### Size & page

A more traditional approach is to provide the ability to specify the number
of items per page by mean of the `size` parameter, and specify the page's number
with the `page` parameter.

For example, an API based on this approach, upon requesting **10** items per
page, would work as follows:

- `/api/foo/bar/?limit=10` (implies `page=0`)
- `/api/foo/bar/?limit=10&page=1`
- `/api/foo/bar/?limit=10&page=2`
- `/api/foo/bar/?limit=10&page=3`

And so on.
